All folder locations are defined relatively. The parent folder contains any data sets and a folder called "Repo". Inside Repo are two folders: one where all the files in the repository are, and the other where the results are saved to

Side band fitting takes in a data set, iterates through all the detunings, averages the results for each detuning, fits the curve and extracts Gamma_m, and then saves the results to a file for that power level. get_files_1 works for data sets with the same format as 15112022 and get_files_2 works for data sets with the same format as 16112022_overnight.

Plot gamma takes the files generated by side bband fitting and plots them all on one graph.

Things to do:
1: Add title, axis labels, and better label numbering to plot produced by plot gamma code
2: Get side band fitting code to show the plot with fit for each detuning so it can be reviewed manually to ensure that the fit has worked. An alternative idea is to compute the covariance matrix and use it as a heuristic for whether the plot has worked.
