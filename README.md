Side band fitting takes in a data set, iterates through all the detunings, averages the results for each detuning, fits the curve and extracts Gamma_m, and then saves the results to a file for that power level. get_files_1 works for data sets with the same format as 15112022 and get_files_2 works for data sets with the same format as 16112022_overnight.

Plot gamma takes the files generated by side bband fitting and plots them all on one graph
